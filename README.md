##Inventory Management Tool

This is the inventory management tool for taking into account the Products and Parts that can be associated with the inventory. This is not connected to a database and is stored in the main file itself. 

####Future Track
- Later on have it connected to a database
- Later on refactor the code to have certain functions be all located in the same class instead of duplicating the code
- Automate the input textfields to check the datatype of the textfield as the user presses the keys
